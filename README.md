## Logstash Docker Images
This is [million12/logstash](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/million12/logstash/) docker image with logstash server. It's based on [CentOS-7](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/centos/) official docker image.

## ENV variables
### SERVER_CN	
Default: `SERVER_CN=server.com`  
For your own server canonical name, simply edit it.

## Usage
### Basic

    docker run \
    -d \
    --name logstash \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    million12/logstash

### Mount custom config , override some options

User can provide config (`logstash.conf`) file by sharing it from host os.  

Run example (assuming your `logstash.conf` is located in `/etc/logstash/logstash.conf` on host os):  

    docker run \
    -d \
    --name logstash \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -v /etc/logstash:/etc/logstash \
    million12/logstash

Certificates will be created on the first run and kept in `/etc/logstash/ssl` directory.  
If you run docker image with `-v /etc/logstash:/etc/logstash` certificates will accessible on host os in: `/etc/logstash/ssl/*`

## Logstash Forwarder  
For pushing your logs into Logstash make sure you have copied certificated to your logged machine and set up logstash-forwarder accourdigly to it's [manual](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash-forwarder).
